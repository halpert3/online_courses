# Order of an SQL query

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column, AGG_FUNC(*column_or_expression*),â€¦ 
	FROM mytable    
	JOIN another_table      
		ON mytable.column = another_table.column    
	WHERE *constraint_expression*    
	GROUP BY column    
	HAVING *constraint_expression*    
	ORDER BY *column* ASC/DESC    
	LIMIT *count* OFFSET *COUNT*;
```



# Restaurant Datasets



## Challenge 1

Create a list of all customers with:

* first name
* last name
* email

Sort it alphabetically by last name.

```sqlite
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email 
FROM Customers
ORDER BY LastName ASC;
```



## Challenge 2

Create a table for RSVP's to the party with:

* CustomerID
* PartySize

```sqlite
CREATE TABLE AnniversaryAttendees (
	"CustomerID" INT,
	"PartySize" INT
);
```

*Don't forget you need to put "quotes" around the field names.*



## Challenge 3

Create 3 menus.

* All items sorted by price, low to high
* Appetizers and beverages by type (sorted by type)
* All items except beverages by type (sorted by type)

```sqlite
SELECT DishID, name, price, Type 
FROM Dishes
ORDER BY Price;

-- -- 

SELECT DishID, name, price, Type 
FROM Dishes
WHERE Type = "Appetizer" or Type = "Beverage"
ORDER BY Type;
-- --

SELECT DishID, name, price, Type 
FROM Dishes
WHERE Type IS NOT "Beverage"
ORDER BY Type;

-- OR

SELECT DishID, name, price, Type 
FROM Dishes
WHERE Type != "Beverage"
ORDER BY Type;
```



## Challenge 4

Insert a customer's info into the database. 

```sqlite
INSERT INTO Customers 
(FirstName, LastName, Email, Address, City, State, Phone, Birthday)
VALUES 
('John', 'Smith', 'jsmith@google.com', '44 Elm St.', 'New Orleans', 'LA', '504-444-5555', '1971-01-01')

```



## Challenge 5

Change customer's address.

* Taylor Jenkins in DC to 74 Pine St. New York, NY

  

```sqlite
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE FirstName LIKE "Tay%";

-- There are 2 Taylor Jenkins's. I want CustomerID 26

UPDATE Customers
SET Address = "74 Pine St.", City = "New York", State = "NY" 
WHERE CustomerID = 26;

```



## Challenge 6

Delete customer from database. Deleting customer with email "tjenkins@rouxacademy.org".



```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Email IS "tjenkins@rouxacademy.org";

-- There are 2 Taylor Jenkins's. I want CustomerID 4

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 4;
```



## Challenge 7



Using the customer's email, find their ID and enter their party size in the AnniversaryAttendees table.

* Ashley with the email atapley2j@kinetecoinc.com is bringing 4 people 

```sql
INSERT INTO AnniversaryAttendees (CustomerID, PartySize)
VALUES( 
	(SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers WHERE Email = "atapley2j@kinetecoinc.com"),
	4); 
```

Notes:

* With sqlite, you need the VALUES keyword, which you may not need in other forms of SQL.
* After VALUES, parentheses are needed, and any SELECT statements need to be in parentheses, too.

**Git commit**

## Challenge 8

Search for a reservation by name without knowing the exact spelling.

"Stevenson" or something like it and four people in reservation. 

```sql
SELECT C.FirstName, C.LastName, R.ReservationID, R.Date  
FROM Customers AS C
JOIN Reservations AS R 
ON C.CustomerID = R.CustomerID
WHERE C.LastName like "Ste%"
	AND R.PartySize = 4;
```



This still gives you several reservations. But if you know today's date (which they didn't say in the video), you can find the right one. 

## Challenge 9

Create a reservation 

* Sam McAdams - 14 July 2020, 6 pm, 5 people
* smac@rouxacademy.com / (555) 555-1212



He's not already a customer so add him into the database.

```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone)
VALUES ("Sam", "McAdams", "smac@rouxacademy.com", "(555) 555-1212");
```

Then add the reservation

```sql
INSERT INTO Reservations (CustomerID, Date, PartySize)
VALUES (
	(SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers WHERE Email = "smac@rouxacademy.com"),
	"2020-07-14 18:00:00",
	5
    );
```

It works, but when I double checked, I found the Reservation table wasn't set up with a primary key or to autoincrement it.

## Challenge 10

**Create order:**

- Loretta Hundey
- 6939 Elka Place
- Order:
  - House Salad,
  - Mini Cheeseburgers
  - Tropical Blue Smoothie

**Challenge**

- Create an order
- Find the customer
- Create the order record
- Add the items to the order
- Find the total cost 



Their way is confusing, so I'm changing up the sequence. 

### Find the customer

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Address = "6939 Elka Place";
```

Her CustomerID is 70.

### Create the order

Does not auto-increment so I'm adding the ID as 1001. 

```sql
INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate)
VALUES (1001, 70, "2021-12-25 09:00:00");
```

### Add items to the order

```sql
SELECT DishID, Name, Price FROM Dishes
WHERE 
	Name = "House Salad" or 
	name = "Mini Cheeseburgers" or 
	name="Tropical Blue Smoothie";
```

You get IDs 4, 7, 20. 



Checking OrdersDishesID, it doesn't auto-increment and last one is 4021.

```sql
INSERT INTO OrdersDishes (OrdersDishesID, OrderID, DishID)
VALUES (4022, 1001, 4);
INSERT INTO OrdersDishes (OrdersDishesID, OrderID, DishID)
VALUES (4023, 1001, 7);
INSERT INTO OrdersDishes (OrdersDishesID, OrderID, DishID)
VALUES (4024, 1001, 20);
```

### Find the Cost

```sql
SELECT SUM(Dishes.Price) FROM Dishes
JOIN OrdersDishes 
ON Dishes.DishID = OrdersDishes.DishID
WHERE OrdersDishes.OrderID = 1001;
```



## Challenge 11

Update Cleo's favorite dish as the Quinoa Salmon Salad. (It's currently something else. Changing it from 14 to 9). 

```sql
UPDATE Customers
SET FavoriteDish = 
	(SELECT DishID FROM Dishes WHERE Name like "Quinoa%")
WHERE FirstName = "Cleo";
```





## Challenge 12

Generate a list of the five customers who have placed the most to-go orders.

- Number of orders
- First, last names, email
- Sorted by number of orders

Use both

* customers table
* orders table

```sqlite
SELECT C.FirstName, C.LastName, C.Email, count(O.OrderID) as total
	FROM Orders as O
	JOIN Customers as C
		ON O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
	GROUP BY O.CustomerID
	ORDER BY total DESC
	LIMIT 5;
```



# Library Datasets

## Challenge 13

Find the number of available copies of Dracula.

```sql
SELECT 
	(SELECT count(Books.Title) From Books WHERE Books.Title = "Dracula")
-
	(SELECT count(Books.Title)
		FROM Loans
		JOIN Books
			ON Books.BookID = Loans.BookID
		WHERE  Books.Title = "Dracula" AND Loans.ReturnedDate IS NULL)
AS AvailableBooks;
```



## Challenge 14

Add these to the book table:

* Dracula
* Bram Stoker
* Year: 1897
* New ID: 4819277482



* Gulliver's Travels
* Jonathan Swift
* Year: 1729
* New ID: 4899254401



```sql
INSERT INTO Books (Title, Author, Published, Barcode)
VALUES 
	("Gulliver's Travels", "Jonathan Swift", 1789, 4899254401),
	("Dracula", "Bram Stoker", 1897, 4819277482);
```

Note that you can use the `VALUES` statement more than once. 

## Challenge 15

Check out these books:

* The Picture of Dorian Gray, 2855934983

*From table lookups:*

Those BookIDs are 93 (Great Expectations) and 11 (Dorian Gray).

Patron ID is 50

```sql
INSERT INTO Loans (BookID, PatronID, LoanDate, DueDate)
VALUES
	(93, 50, "2020-08-25", "2020-09-09"),
	(11, 50, "2020-08-25", "2020-09-09");
```





## Challenge 16

Generate report of books due back on July 13, 2020, with patron contact info.

```sql
SELECT DueDate, Books.Title, Books.Author, Patrons.FirstName, Patrons.LastName, Patrons.Email 
	FROM Loans
	JOIN Books
		ON Books.BookID = Loans.BookID
	JOIN Patrons
		ON Patrons.PatronID = Loans.PatronID

```



## Challenge 17

Mark as returned books with barcodes:

- 6435968624
- 5677520613
- 8730298424

...on July 5, 2020.

```sql
UPDATE Loans
	SET ReturnedDate = "2020-07-05"
	WHERE BookID=(SELECT BookID FROM Books WHERE Barcode = "6435968624") 
		AND ReturnedDate is NULL;
```

And repeat for the following...

**Git commit**

## Challenge 18

		ON P.PatronID = L.PatronID
	GROUP BY 
		P.FirstName, P.LastName
	ORDER BY LoanCount ASC
	LIMIT 10;
```

## Challenge 19

	WHERE B.Published > 1889 AND B.Published < 1900
		AND L.ReturnedDate IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY B.BookID
	ORDER BY B.Title;
```

## Challenge 20
